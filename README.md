## UCI Homework #3

This repository contains a password generator. It includes prompts that asks the user criteria such as...
how many characters they want in the password, if they want uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers,
or special characters. 

The application then presents the user with the generated password based on the user's choices of criteria.
